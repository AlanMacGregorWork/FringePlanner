# FringePlanner (In Development)

FringePlanner is a tool completely built-in Swift to guide the planning and scheduling of your next trip to the Fringe. It uses the most up-to-date strategies, including SwiftData, Swift Concurrency & Swift Testing

## How to setup

FringePlanner requires an api key, which can be generated via https://api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/documentation. This can then be included in `./Helper/Keys.xcconfig` to handle authentication
